opengm-externals
================

This projects download, patch and build external non-standard libraries available as source and used by OpenGM

Originally, this was part of the main OpenGM-repro. Due to its increasing size we decide to move it into a separate repro. When reallocation and re-factoring is done OpenGM will use OpenGM-externals.
